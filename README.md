# AbcSmc Python-Wrapper
Python wrapper for Sequential Monte Carlo Approximation for Bayesian Computation. 
ABC-SMC is a parameter estimation and senesitivity analysis library in C++ by Thomas Hladish.

A python wrapper is being developed here to allow stochastic simulations written in python to use the library to fit the model.
